# OpenShift Insights Runtime Extractor
:toc:

This repository provides a mechanism to gather runtime info from containers to get additional insights on user workloads and make investment decisions that will drive utilization.

The container images built from this repository provides an `insights-runtime-extractor`
feature integrated to the https://github.com/openshift/insights-operator/tree/master[OpenShift Insights Operator].

This feature was proposed and approved by https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/blob/master/enhancements/insights/insights-runtime-extractor.md[this enhancement].

This repository is composed of multiple components:

* `fingerprints` - a collection of self-contained executables that are executed in the container process namespaces to extract runtime information
* `extractor` - the "core" engine that queries processes running in containers, detect the relevant fingerprints to run and coordinates their execution to extract information. It is composed of 2 executables:
** the `coordinator`, running with high privileges, that does the extraction of the runtime information and store them on the file system.
** the `extractor_server`, a simple TCP server that awaits for TCP connection to trigger an extraction from the `coordinator` and replies with the path of the extracted data on the file system.
* `exporter` - the "public" access to the extractor. It is a HTTP server, that, upon an HTTP request, will trigger an extraction by connecting to the `extractor_server`. It then reads and aggregates all the runtime information from the file system and replies with a JSON payload.
* `runtime-samples` - a collection of runtime projects to test the components in its end-to-end (e2e) test suite.

This repository provides two container images:

* the `exporter` container that runs the `exporter` HTTP server
* the `extractor` container that runs the `extractor_server` executable and uses the `coordinator` and `fingerprints`
  for the actual extraction of the runtime information

Both containers are meant to run in a single pod and share their file system using a `volume`.

## Build the container images for development

[source,bash]
----
IMAGE_REGISTRY=quay.io/<my-user-name> make build-image
----

It builds 2 multi-arch image (amd64 & arm64) images:

* `$IMAGE_REGISTRY/insights-runtime-extractor:latest`
* `$IMAGE_REGISTRY/insights-runtime-exporter:latest`

## Build the development image for Rust

[source,bash]
----
make build-rust-dev-image
----

This creates a `rust-dev` Container image that contains all the Rust plumbing to compile and execute the code in `extractor`

### Run the development image and compile the Rust code base

[source,bash]
----
make rust-dev

# you are then inside a container ready to compile the Rust code
make
----

## Test the container images

Prequesites:

* To test the container images, you must have access to an OpenShift cluster and
be logged in with a cluster admin account.

To run the end-to-end (e2e) tests, run the command:

[source,bash]
----
IMAGE_REGISTRY=quay.io/<my-user-name> make e2e-test
----

## Run the extractor

Prequisites:

* `curl`, `jq`, `oc` are installed on your machine
* you must have access to an OpenShift cluster and be logged in with a *cluster admin* account

To deploy the insights-runtime-extractor in the `extractor` namespace, run the commands:

[source,bash]
----
oc project extractor
oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/insights-runtime-extractor/main/manifests/insights-runtime-extractor-scc.yaml
oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/insights-runtime-extractor/main/manifests/insights-runtime-extractor.yaml
----

Verify that it is properly deployed:

[source,bash]
----
oc get daemonset -n extractor insights-runtime-extractor
----

It should display that all the daemonset pods are ready:

[source,bash]
----
NAME                         DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   NODE SELECTOR            AGE
insights-runtime-extractor   2         2         2       2            2           kubernetes.io/os=linux   20m
----

Once the `insights-runtime-extractor` is ready, you can extract all the runtime info by running the script:

[source,bash]
----
export NAMESPACE=extractor
curl -s -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift/insights-runtime-extractor/main/scripts/extract.sh | bash -s 
----

This command will create a `out.json` file that contains the extracted runtime info organized by `namespace`, `pod` names and `container` ID:
